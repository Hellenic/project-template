# Nightmare end-to-end testing

> It's not ominous as it sounds

Nightmare is headless browser which allows us to easily write E2E tests. Tests can be run with Jest, so it goes along nicely with rest of our setup.

## Writing more tests

Tests are located in `test/e2e/` folder. You may write these tests manually, or record them with Chrome plugin.

Add your tests to this folder, and Jest will find them, and run them.

## Running tests

`npm run test:e2e`

> Note! This is still in progress. Not everything has been fully setup yet.
