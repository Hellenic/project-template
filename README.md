This is a basic, bare-bones starter template.
It has been kick-started with Razzle and After.js. It also includes
styled-components, Prettier for code style and Jest for testing.
Basically, all you'll need to build magnificent web application.

Clone it, modify it and you have your own custom project with all the cool stuff.
